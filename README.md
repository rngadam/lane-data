En l'honneur de Albert T. Lane, le premier cycliste en Amérique du Nord:

On July 1, 1874, Albert T. Lane, a bookkeeper residing at 16 Fournier Street in Montreal, rode the first bicycle ever seen in North America through the streets of Montreal. It was a penny-farthing style of bicycle, also known as a high wheel or high wheeler, with a 50-inch diameter front wheel and a much smaller rear wheel, and it represented a revolution in transportation. Wealthier citizens began to buy bicycles from Britain and France and in 1878, under Lane’s initiative, the Montreal Bicycle Club (MBC) was founded. Shortly after, the MBC merged with the Montreal Lacrosse Club and the Montreal Snow Shoe Club to form the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association or MAAA.
